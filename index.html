                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello, I am Aditya Garg, I am a student at University of Queensland pursuing Masters of Engineering, my field of study is computer science. From a very young age I had a curious mind about how exactly anything works, so whenever i was playing with some toy I would get an itch that would lead me to open up the toy and look at its inner workings. Once i was satisfied with how it worked I would move onto the next. Then my father got us a computer and it opened up a whole new world where something made up of parts and using electricity got me access to anything in the world with the help of internet. Thus, started my journey towards computer science. I wanted to know how it all worked and during my high school decided to pursue it as my future field of study. Well now here i am trying to learn as much as possible and trying to achieve my goal of becoming a data scientist and working for some of the biggest companies in the world such as IBM, apple, google and so on. Other than this i love swimming whenever i get a chance, cook or even try food from different parts of the world and travel so I can learn about cultures throughout the world.
